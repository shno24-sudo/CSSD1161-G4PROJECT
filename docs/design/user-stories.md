# User Stories

## Context 
A large goal that is broken up into multiple user stories with specific concerns

## Content
 - As a film student I want to see credible reviews so that I can use them for school assignments. 
 - As an elderly user I want my reviews to be credible and not face the backlash from other reviewers/users, so that I can continue using the app comfortably. 

## Decisions (if any)
 - N/A

## Next Steps
 - See how we can implement the user stories to improve our product
